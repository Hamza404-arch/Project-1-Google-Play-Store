# Project-1-Google-Play-Store

My aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable. Assuming im working as data analysts for a company that builds mobile apps, and my job is to enable my team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

At my company, i only build apps that are free to download and install, and my main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that my revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use my app. My goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

#Conclusion
